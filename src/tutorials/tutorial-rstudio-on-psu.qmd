## What is RStudio?

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for doing data science.
An IDE is a computer program that provides tools for people who are developing and testing software.
You might not think of yourself as a software developer (yet).
But RStudio is a powerful tool for beginners, too.
It began life as a tool primarily for users writing code in R, hence the name.
RStudio supports multiple programming languages, including R and Python.
