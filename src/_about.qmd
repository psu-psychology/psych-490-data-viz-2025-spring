<https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2381584>

Most of the course content will be found on this site.

## Course structure

This is a discussion-focused course.
On most days we will discuss readings assigned prior to class.
On many days, we will work together or individually on the assigned [exercises](index.qmd#exercises), the final project, or another assignment.
