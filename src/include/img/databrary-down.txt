Thank you for your inquiry about the status of the Databrary system and for your use of the system to store, share, and access research data.
 
The technical team estimates that a new, upgraded Databrary system will go live and be accessible to users in early February.
 
For the next several weeks, Databrary will only be accessible to researchers who connect to the NYU network via the NYU VPN application and who select the 2-All Traffic option. Once the Databrary system is back online, the link to your Databrary volume should work as before without requiring the NYU VPN.
 
We apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you and your collaborators, but we are hopeful that you will find the new Databrary system an even more useful tool for open scholarship.

Thank you for your inquiry about the status of the Databrary system and for your use of the system to store and share research data.

We recognize that you may not have kept local copies of files you store on Databrary or that you rely on Databrary as your IRB-approved method of data sharing. Thus, you may have a need to access those files for critical purposes, such as to meet grant submission or other deadlines prior to Databrary going live again. Databrary has been given permission by NYU information security to help such users to access their data on Databrary on a case-by-case basis. If you are facing such deadlines or other critical circumstances, please provide more information so that NYU can consider the request. In doing so, please specify the *minimum* number of users from your group who would require access in order to address the critical circumstance.
 
We apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you and your collaborators, but we are hopeful that you will find the new Databrary system an even more useful tool for open scholarship.
 
Yours truly,
 
Karen Adolph & Rick Gilmore
