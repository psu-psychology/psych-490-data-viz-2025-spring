## Today

- Making Data
- Types of data

# Making Data

---

>Data are made, not born.

Gilmore 2025

---

>No one really knows how the game is played... \
>The art of the trade \
>How the sausage gets made \
>We just assume that it happens \
>But no one else is in the room where it happens

"The Room Where it Happens", Leslie Odom Jr. and Lin-Manuel Miranda, "Hamilton"

## How are data made?

>- By measurement

## What is measurement?

>- A *procedure for mapping* properties of X onto some numerical standard or scale Y
>- [*Metrology*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrology): The science of measurement
>- [*Psychometrics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics): The study of psychological measurement

## Why 'mapping'?

## Data ~ quantitative terminology

- Data a *symbol* of the thing measured, not the thing itself
- E.g., words are a *symbol* of the things they refer to

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-semantic-mapping
%%| fig-cap: "Mapping from concept/entity to a word."
flowchart TB
  A[Cute animal with fur that purrs] --> B('cat')
  A ---> C('gato')
  A ---> D('chatte/chat')
  A ---> E('çŒ«')
```

## Symbols reflect, select, and deflect

>Even if any given terminology is a *reflection* of reality, by its very nature as a terminology, it must be a *selection* of reality; and to this extent must also as a *deflection* of reality

@Burke1968-ye

## What is reflected, selected, deflected?

## Stevens' scales of measurement

![@Stevens1946-sh](../include/img/stevens-1946-fig.png)

## Questions about measurement

- What's the procedure for making this mapping?
- What are the rules for assigning numbers/categories?
- What can we do with the assigned numbers (summarize, depict)?

## Why does measurement matter?

# Types of data

## In other domains

- Business/economics
- Politics
- Sports
- Entertainment
- Weather

## In psychology

- Internal mental states
- Behaviors
- Physiological processes
- Physical characteristics
- Environmental properties

## Examples of...

- Internal mental states
- Behaviors
- Physiological processes
- Physical characteristics
- Environmental properties

## How to measure...

- Internal mental states
- Behaviors

## Making data

- [Exercise 03](../exercises/ex03-making-data.qmd)

# Main points

---

- Data are *made*
  - Map characteristics to quantities
  - By some measurement procedure
  - Reflect, but also select and deflect
- Mappings have different scale types [@Stevens1946-sh]
- Scales determine i) permissible/logical stats & ii) best visualizations
