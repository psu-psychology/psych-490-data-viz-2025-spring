## Your thoughts

Should a scientific paper's main findings be visible in some sort of visualization?

Why or why not?

## How are data made?

>- By measurement

## What is measurement?

>- A *procedure for mapping* properties of X onto some numerical standard or scale Y
>- [*Metrology*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrology): The science of measurement
>- [*Psychometrics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics): The study of psychological measurement

## Why 'mapping'

## Data ~ quantitative terminology

- Data a *symbol* of the thing measured, not the thing itself
- E.g., Words are a *symbol* of the things they refer to

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-semantic-mapping
%%| fig-cap: "Mapping from concept/entity to a word."
flowchart TB
  A[Cute animal with fur that purrs] --> B('cat')
  A ---> C('gato')
  A ---> D('chatte/chat')
  A ---> E('çŒ«')
```

## Data reflects, selects, and deflects

>Even if any given terminology is a *reflection* of reality, by its very nature as a terminology, it must be a *selection* of reality; and to this extent must also as a *deflection* of reality

@Burke1968-ye

## What is reflected, selected, deflected?

## Stevens' scales of measurement

![@Stevens1946-sh](../include/img/stevens-1946-fig.png)

## Questions about measurement

- What's the procedure for making this mapping?
- What are the rules for assigning numbers?
- What can we do with the assigned numbers (summarize, depict)?

# Types of data

## In other domains

- Business/economics
- Politics
- Sports
- Entertainment
- Weather

## In psychology

- Internal mental states
- Behaviors
- Physiological processes
- Physical characteristics
- Environmental properties

## Examples of...

- Internal mental states
- Behaviors
- Physiological processes
- Physical characteristics
- Environmental properties

## How to measure...

- Internal mental states
- Behaviors
- Physiological processes
- Physical characteristics
- Environmental properties

## Scales of measurement

![@Stevens1946-sh](../include/img/stevens-1946-table.png)

## Your surveys...

- Nominal
- Ordinal
- Interval
- Ratio

# Main points

- Data are *made*
  - Map characteristics to quantities
  - By some measurement procedure
  - Reflect, but also select and deflect
- Mapping has different types of scales [@Stevens1946-sh]
- Scales determine i) permissible stats & ii) best visualizations

# Next time

*Visualization in business, industry, & government*
