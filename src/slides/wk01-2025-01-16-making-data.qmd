# Making Data

## How are data made?

>- By measurement

## What is measurement?

>- A procedure for mapping properties of X onto some numerical standard or scale Y
>- *Psychometrics*: The study of psychological measurement

## Burke's 'Terministic Screen'

>Even if any given terminology is a *reflection* of reality, by its very nature as a terminology, it must be a *selection* of reality; and to this extent must also as a *deflection* of reality

@Burke1968-ye

- Data ~ quantitative terminology
  - a symbol of the thing measured, not the thing itself
- Data selects, reflects, and deflects
