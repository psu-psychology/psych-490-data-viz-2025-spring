## The symbolic animal

- [Ernst Cassirer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Cassirer)

>Cassirer argues that the classic Aristotelian definition of the human being as a rational animal is wrong, or at least incomplete. Instead we should think of ourselves as “symbolic animals,” since ratiocination is only one expression of the human instinct to think in symbols. @Kirsch2021-fd

## The communicating animal

- Communication as transmission of information
- From world

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[World] --> B[You]
```


## Communication

- From others (direct)

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[Me] --> B[You]
```

- From others (via some medium)

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[Me] --> B((Medium))
  B --> C[You]
```

## Media

- Source of [*signs*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_(semiotics))^[more general than language]
- Sign relation
  - Sign (as a thing) --> Meaning
  - Relation is arbitrary, defined by social convention (Sausurre)

## Core qualities of sign systems

- Semantics
  - Relation between signs --> meaning
- Syntax (grammar)
  - Rules/conventions for arranging signs

## Communication between minds

- Via signs and symbols
- Based on shared social conventions
- About sign relations (what signs "mean" or convey)
- Open vs. closed symbol systems

## Sign systems can unite/inform or divide/confuse

## Sign system grammars

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
- $2+2*3=4$ vs. $2+(2*3)=4$
- "Up with you I will not put." vs. "I will not put up with you."

## How scientists communicate (formally)

- Papers
- Posters
- Textbooks
- Websites
- Talks

## Components of a scientific papers

- Text
  - Explanation/argument
  - Evidence (statistical summaries)
- Figures
- Tables
  - Evidence (statistical summaries)
- References
- Data, materials

## Questions about scientific communication

- What do the words mean?
- What do the numbers/statistics mean?
- What do the figures mean?
- Does the evidence (+ argument) persuade?

## Semiotics/Semiology of Graphics

![@Bertin2010-dz](../include/img/bertin-semiology-of-graphics.png)

## Semiotics of data visualization

- What do the components mean?
- What message is the visualization creator trying to convey?

A semiotic perspective can be infectious and addictive.

Signs and sign systems are *everywhere*!

# Visualization in psychological science

## Questions

- Are there common types of visualizations in psychological science?
- What (types) messages are conveyed?
- How clearly are they conveyed?
- How are the following depicted:
  - Responses to surveys
  - Performance on tasks/tests
  - Brain structure or activity

# Main points

## Semiotics of data visualization

- *Semiotics*: study of signs and symbols
- What meanings do the visual elements of data graphics convey?
- How do data visualizations relate to other communicative elements?

## Visualization in psychological science

- Conventions (common patterns) in data visualization
- Different viz types for different psychological measures?

# Next time

*Visualization in government & business*
