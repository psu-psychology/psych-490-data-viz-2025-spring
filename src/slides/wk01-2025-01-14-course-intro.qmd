## Purpose & goals

::: {.incremental}
- What are data? Where do data come from?
- Who visualizes data, how do they visualize it, and why?
- How does vision science inform how we perceive patterns in data?
- What's the relationship between non-visual and visual ways of understanding data?
- What makes a data visualization effective?
- What makes a data visualization misleading?
- How can we make better data visualizations?

  - 'Smith is an idiot.'
  - 'Smith tried to demonstrate that pigs can fly by tossing a few off the 
  roof of Old Main. That's nonsense and made a huge mess.'
