## What I'm saying

- Can't & shouldn't hide from controversy
- Don't all have to agree
- Should (I hope) agree to continue to debate & discuss
- Seek out, but not require agreement

## Today

- Why R we doing this?
- Getting started with DataCamp

# Why R we doing this?

## Why Learn R?

::: {.incremental}
- It's fun.
- It's free.
- Amaze your friends; dazzle your rivals.
- Powerful, especially for manipulating, plotting, and analyzing data.
- **It will make you a more productive researcher.**
- Practical job-related skill
:::

> What if I want to learn another programming language?

- Awesome! Go for it!
- Easier or more poetic to say some things in some languages than in others.
- Python, Matlab, *nix shell programming, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, SQL, C/C++, and Java

## RStudio

- Available in PSU computer labs
- Free download from <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>
  - Download and install R first
  - Install RStudio second
- Coming soon: Run in the cloud

## Console

- Talk to R
- Get a reply

---

```{r}
#| include: true
#| echo: true
license()
```

## Painful lesson #1

Computers are super-literal. They are anally literal. More anally literal than any human being you've *ever* had to deal with. 

You're not going to change them. Being this anal is their superpower.

Just deal.
:::

## Parts of console

- Prompt (`> `); cursor (`|`)
- History of conversation via up/down arrows
- Enter a command, then hit `enter` or `return` to say it to R

---

```{r}
#| include: true
#| echo: true
sum(1, 4, 7)
```

## Functions

- Tell the computer to do something
- FUNCTION_NAME: what to do
- ARGUMENTS: what to do it to/on and how
- `sum`: function name
- `(1, 4, 7)`: arguments/inputs
  - Parentheses are like open hands giving the function something it wants

---

```{r}
#| include: true
#| echo: true

mean(1, 4, 7)
```

---

```{r}
#| include: true
#| echo: true

mean(c(1, 4, 7))

sum(1, 4, 7)/3
```

## 

---

```{r}
#| include: true
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
sort(4, 1, 7)
```

## Getting help

```{r}
help("sort")
```

## `sort()` again

```{r}
#| include: true
#| echo: true

sort(c(4, 1, 7))
```

## The `c()` command/function

- *C*oncatenates or *C*ombines items into a single thing

```{r}
#| include: true
#| echo: true

c(4, 1, 7)

c(1:15)
```


## Assignments

```{r}
#| include: true
#| echo: true

my_age <- 61 # My age. Beats the alternative, I guess.

# Text that is preceded by the # character is called a comment.
# These are 'notes' you can keep about your code so you remember why you
# did something. Here, R ignores the part after the #: ' Rick's age'
```

## Assignments (continued)

- Give (assign) number (`61`) a useful/informative name (`my_age`)
- Leftward arrow (`<-`) (option/alt + minus): assignment command

---

```{r}
#| include: true
#| echo: true

your_age <- 21
your_shoe_size <- 8.5

your_age + your_shoe_size

your_shoe_size/your_age
```

---

::: {.callout-important}
## Don't use `=`, use `<-`

- You can substitute `=` but don't. Use `<-`.
- It's stylistic, but style matters.
- It's like saying 'like' all the time. Like people will like understand you, but they'll wonder why you like say like all the time when you really need not. 
- It's also a topic that could get you in a 'flame war'. 
- **Avoid flame wars** if you can. Life is too short.
:::

## Asking questions

- comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, etc.).

```{r}
#| include: true
#| echo: true

1 == 0
sqrt(9) < 4
```

---

```{r}
#| include: true
#| echo: true

'rick' == 'rick'
'richard' > 'rick' # 'h' < 'k'
'richard' != 'rick'
```

## What can we talk to R about?

- Strings (sequences of letters, numbers, characters)

```{r}
#| include: true
#| echo: true

c('w', 'x', 'y', 'z')

middle_letters <- c('m', 'n', 'o')
```

## What can we talk to R about?

- numbers
    - 3.14159
  - 4^2
  - 1e3
  
## What can we talk to R about?

- data sets
- plots
- analyses

---

```{r}
#| include: true
#| echo: true

rand_x <- rnorm(100)
rand_y <- rnorm(100)
my_plot <- plot(rand_x, rand_y) # Give the plot a name
my_plot # Show the plot
```

## Rules for naming things

1. Replace spaces (and hyphens/minus characters `-`) with underscores (`_`), and 
2. Start names with letters, not numbers.

- acceptable names for things: `bigly`, `good_name`, `a_longer_good_name`, `Good_name1`, and even `thisIsCamelCaseNoUnderscores` 
- unacceptable names: `!good`, `bad name` (has a space) or `1_very_bad_name` (starts with a number).
