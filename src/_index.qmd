## Themes

If a picture's worth a thousand words [@Wikipedia-contributors2024-du], what exactly does it say? This course will focus on the psychology of data visualization—how to read, critique, and generate meaningful figures that inform but don’t mislead. We’ll take inspiration from recognized classic figures and unpack what makes them exemplary. We’ll critique figures that deliberately or inadvertently mislead or confuse. We'll learn what 150 years of vision science, the foundation of experimental psychology, has to say about data visualization. And we’ll learn how to build our own reproducible figures using Python, R, and JavaScript. No prior programming experience is required.
