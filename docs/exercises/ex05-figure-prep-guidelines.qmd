## Dates {-}

## Goals {-}

1. Read and understand published figure preparation guidelines for prospective authors of scientific manuscripts.
2. Evaluate the guidelines relative to the best practices we've discussed this semester in class.

## Assignment {-}

### Background

Some scientific journals provide advice to prospective authors about how to prepare figures for manuscripts submitted to the journals.
Here are two examples:

- [Nature](https://www.nature.com/documents/natrev-figure-guidelines-v1.pdf)
- [American Psychological Association (APA)](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/tables-figures)

### Tasks

1. Find and read critically the guidelines for publishing figures in a journal of your choosing.
2. Compare the guidelines to the best practices that we have discussed this semester in class [@@Franconeri2021-uv; @Knaflic2015-wq; @Tufte2001-cb].
3. Do the guidelines reflect current knowledge about data visualization practices. If not how could the guidelines be amended to provide better guidance to authors in these journals?

## Submit {-}

A 3-5 pp (750-1,300 word) write-up of your findings.
