## Dates {-}

In-class work on Tuesday, January 14 and Thursday, January 16.

Submit write-up by Tuesday, January 21.

## Goals {-}

In this exercise, you will work with a team of classmates to create a survey using the Google [Forms](https://forms.google.com) tool.
The survey you create will be used later in the course for data visualizations that you will also create.

## Assignment {-}

0. Sign-in to the Google drive account associated with your Penn State Access ID. This will make it somewhat easier for us to share forms.
1. Open Google Forms by visiting <https://forms.google.com>.
2. Create a new form by clicking on the 'Blank Form' button.

3. Give your form a useful title, for example, 'PSYCH-490.003-2025-spring-team-A'

::: {.callout-important}
You will be assigned a team name/letter.
:::

4. Customize the theme if you wish by clicking on the palette icon.

5. Create a survey with 8 questions. Your questions should be ones that your classmates can answer without embarrassment or loss of privacy and which meet the following criteria:

- Generate two questions with nominal (un-ordered) answers (e.g., favorite color).
- Generate two questions with ordinal (e.g., 1-5) answers analogous to a Likert scale.
- Generate two questions with continuous answers (e.g., age and shoe size). It doesn't matter if these are interval or ratio scaled.
- Generate one question with a date or time as an answer (e.g., a favorite relative's birthday).
- Include one field for comments.

6. What type(s) of interfaces work best for these question types? Why?

7. When you are happy with a draft of your survey, conduct a quality assurance (QA) review of it by having your team take the survey. The easiest way to do this is to use the 'Send' button to send your survey to your collaborators.

Make sure to have your QA testers answer the Comments question with the same response, e.g., 'test-response'. This will make it easier later to filter-out the test responses.

8. Make sure that all of your collaborators have edit privileges on the form. Click on the 'more' button with three dots and add collaborators.
