Dr. Gilmore has stored his Google account credentials in a special environment file that can be accessed by the R command Sys.getenv(\"GMAIL_SURVEY\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt’s vital to be very careful when creating and sharing code like this that involves sensitive information like login credentials.\nGilmore likes to put credentials in an .Renviron file that lives in his home directory. This is a recommended practice. On Mac OS and Linux, that’s ~/.Renviron. You can use the usethis::edit_r_profile() command at the R console (not the Terminal) to open your own .Renviron file. In Gilmore’s case, he has added the following line to that file:\nGMAIL_SURVEY=\"&lt;my-google-account&gt;\"\nHere, he has substituted his Google account with credentials/access to the required files for &lt;my-google-account&gt;. Then, when the R code below calls Sys.getenv(\"GMAIL_SURVEY\"), the value of those credentials is returned as a text string.\nMake sure to close and save the .Renviron file and restart your R session before testing this yourself.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nif (!dir.exists('csv')) {\n  message(\"Creating missing `csv/`.\")\n  dir.create(\"csv\")\n}\n\nif (params$update_data) {\n  options(gargle_oauth_email = Sys.getenv(\"GMAIL_SURVEY\"))\n  googledrive::drive_auth()\n\n  googledrive::drive_download(\n    \"PSYCH-490.003-Spr-2025-Psych-Viz\",\n    path = file.path(\"csv\", params$fn),\n    type = \"csv\",\n    overwrite = TRUE\n  )\n  message(\"Data updated.\")\n} else {\n  message(\"Using stored data.\")\n}\n\n\nThe data file has been saved as a comma-separated value (CSV) format data file in a special directory called csv/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBecause these data might contain sensitive or identifiable information, we only keep a local copy and do not share it publicly via GitHub. This is achieved by adding the name of the data directory to a special .gitignore file."

An IDE is a computer program that provides tools for people who are developing and testing software. You might not think of yourself as a software developer (yet). But RStudio is a powerful tool for beginners, too. It began life as a tool primarily for users writing code in R, hence the name. RStudio supports multiple programming languages, including R and Python."

We made them up!\nKeep that in mind while we work through what we would do to answer the question if these were not fake, random data.\n\n\nTo answer that question, we’d have to compare our results with some other pattern, a pattern where there is no favorite. In other words, we want a pattern where the counts are all equal. So, we’re back to summarizing.\nActually, data analysis in the real world usually involves a back-and-forth alternation between summarizing/analyzing and visualizing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A[Summarize] --&gt; B[Visualize]\n  B ---&gt; A\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Illustration of the back and forth between summarizing and visualizing that characterizes real-life data analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummarizing II\nLet’s make data that have an identical pattern across all colors.\nThere are several ways to do this, but here is one that works.\n\n\nCode\nno_favorite &lt;- rep(colors, length(our_color_sample)/length(colors))\n\ncompare_df &lt;- data.frame(favorite_color = no_favorite)\n\nxtabs(formula = ~favorite_color, data = compare_df)\n\n\nfavorite_color\n black   blue  brown   gray  green orange    red violet  white yellow \n    20     20     20     20     20     20     20     20     20     20 \n\n\nHow can we compare the data where there are no differences by category to the data where there are differences?"

All students should act with personal integrity, respect others dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts (Faculty Senate Policy 49-20). Sanctions for academic misconduct can include a grade of F for the course as well as other penalties.\nUnless you are told otherwise, you must complete all course work entirely on your own, using only sources that have been permitted by your instructor, and you may not assist other students with papers, quizzes, exams, or other assessments. If I allow you to use ideas, images, or word phrases created by another person (e.g., from Course Hero or Chegg) or by generative technology, such as ChatGPT, you must identify their source.\nWhen you complete assignments, remember the ABCs to avoid plagiarism: Always place copied information within quotation marks, include information about the quoted or paraphrased source in a Bibliography, and Cite the source in the body (in the text) of your paper immediately after the quoted or paraphrased information. When in doubt, cite in the text and include the source in a bibliography.\nStudents with questions about academic integrity should ask me or the TA before submitting work.\nStudents facing allegations of academic misconduct may not drop/withdraw from the affected course unless they are cleared of wrongdoing (see G-9: Academic Integrity). Attempted drops will be prevented or reversed, and students will be expected to complete course work and meet course deadlines. Students who are found responsible for academic integrity violations face academic outcomes, which can be severe, and put themselves at jeopardy for other outcomes which may include ineligibility for Dean’s List, pass/fail elections, and grade forgiveness. Students may also face consequences from their home/major program and/or The Schreyer Honors College."

The Penn State Principles were developed to embody the values that we hope our students, faculty, staff, administration, and alumni possess. At the same time, the University is strongly committed to freedom of expression. Consequently, these Principles do not constitute University policy and are not intended to interfere in any way with an individual’s academic or personal freedoms. We hope, however, that individuals will voluntarily endorse these common principles, thereby contributing to the traditions and scholarly heritage left by those who preceded them, and will thus leave Penn State a better place for those who follow.\nI will respect the dignity of all individuals within the Penn State community. The University is committed to creating and maintaining an educational environment that respects the right of all individuals to participate fully in the community. Actions motivated by hate, prejudice, or intolerance violate this principle. I will not engage in any behaviors that compromise or demean the dignity of individuals or groups, including intimidation, stalking, harassment, discrimination, taunting, ridiculing, insulting, or acts of violence. I will demonstrate respect for others by striving to learn from differences between people, ideas, and opinions and by avoiding behaviors that inhibit the ability of other community members to feel safe or welcome as they pursue their academic goals.\nI will practice academic integrity. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at Penn State University, allowing the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest, and responsible manner. In accordance with the University Code of Conduct, I will practice integrity in regard to all academic assignments. I will not engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception because such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.\nI will demonstrate social and personal responsibility. The University is a community that promotes learning; any behaviors that are inconsistent with that goal are unacceptable. Irresponsible behaviors, including alcohol or drug abuse and the use of violence against people or property, undermine the educational climate by threatening the physical and mental health of members of the community. I will exercise personal responsibility for my actions and I will make sure that my actions do not interfere with the academic and social environment of the University. I will maintain a high standard of behavior by adhering to the Code of Conduct and respecting the rights of others.\nI will be responsible for my own academic progress and agree to comply with all University policies. The University allows students to identify and achieve their academic goals by providing the information needed to plan the chosen program of study and the necessary educational opportunities, but students assume final responsibility for course scheduling, program planning, and the successful completion of graduation requirements. I will be responsible for seeking the academic and career information needed to meet my educational goals by becoming knowledgeable about the relevant policies, procedures, and rules of the University and academic program, by consulting and meeting with my adviser, and by successfully completing all of the requirements for graduation.\n\n\nPenn State Values\nIntegrity: We act with integrity and honesty in accordance with the highest academic, professional, and ethical standards.\nRespect: We respect and honor the dignity of each person, embrace civil discourse, and foster a diverse and inclusive community.\nResponsibility: We act responsibly, and we are accountable for our decisions, actions, and their consequences.\nDiscovery: We seek and create new knowledge and understanding, and foster creativity and innovation, for the benefit of our communities, society, and the environment.\nExcellence: We strive for excellence in all our endeavors as individuals, an institution, and a leader in higher education.\nCommunity: We work together for the betterment of our University, the communities we serve, and the world."

The Penn State Principles were developed to embody the values that we hope our students, faculty, staff, administration, and alumni possess. At the same time, the University is strongly committed to freedom of expression. Consequently, these Principles do not constitute University policy and are not intended to interfere in any way with an individual’s academic or personal freedoms. We hope, however, that individuals will voluntarily endorse these common principles, thereby contributing to the traditions and scholarly heritage left by those who preceded them, and will thus leave Penn State a better place for those who follow.\nI will respect the dignity of all individuals within the Penn State community. The University is committed to creating and maintaining an educational environment that respects the right of all individuals to participate fully in the community. Actions motivated by hate, prejudice, or intolerance violate this principle. I will not engage in any behaviors that compromise or demean the dignity of individuals or groups, including intimidation, stalking, harassment, discrimination, taunting, ridiculing, insulting, or acts of violence. I will demonstrate respect for others by striving to learn from differences between people, ideas, and opinions and by avoiding behaviors that inhibit the ability of other community members to feel safe or welcome as they pursue their academic goals.\nI will practice academic integrity. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at Penn State University, allowing the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest, and responsible manner. In accordance with the University Code of Conduct, I will practice integrity in regard to all academic assignments. I will not engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception because such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.\nI will demonstrate social and personal responsibility. The University is a community that promotes learning; any behaviors that are inconsistent with that goal are unacceptable. Irresponsible behaviors, including alcohol or drug abuse and the use of violence against people or property, undermine the educational climate by threatening the physical and mental health of members of the community. I will exercise personal responsibility for my actions and I will make sure that my actions do not interfere with the academic and social environment of the University. I will maintain a high standard of behavior by adhering to the Code of Conduct and respecting the rights of others.\nI will be responsible for my own academic progress and agree to comply with all University policies. The University allows students to identify and achieve their academic goals by providing the information needed to plan the chosen program of study and the necessary educational opportunities, but students assume final responsibility for course scheduling, program planning, and the successful completion of graduation requirements. I will be responsible for seeking the academic and career information needed to meet my educational goals by becoming knowledgeable about the relevant policies, procedures, and rules of the University and academic program, by consulting and meeting with my adviser, and by successfully completing all of the requirements for graduation.\n\n\nPenn State Values\nIntegrity: We act with integrity and honesty in accordance with the highest academic, professional, and ethical standards.\nRespect: We respect and honor the dignity of each person, embrace civil discourse, and foster a diverse and inclusive community.\nResponsibility: We act responsibly, and we are accountable for our decisions, actions, and their consequences.\nDiscovery: We seek and create new knowledge and understanding, and foster creativity and innovation, for the benefit of our communities, society, and the environment.\nExcellence: We strive for excellence in all our endeavors as individuals, an institution, and a leader in higher education.\nCommunity: We work together for the betterment of our University, the communities we serve, and the world."

Windows users will select windows and Mac users will select macosx.\n\nMac users\nHere is the window that opens:\n\nNotice that there are two links under the “Latest release:” section. To decide which version is appropriate for you, you need to select the version of R that is appropriate for your computer’s central processing unit (CPU) and operating system (OS). Here’s how to find out what CPU and OS you’re running:\n\nClick on the Apple icon in the top left corner of your menu bar.\n\n\n\nSelect the ‘About This Mac’ menu item.\nA window will appear with information about your computer.\n\n\nIf the ‘macOS’ field has a number greater than 11 (MacOS Big Sur), then you can download the latest version of R. If the ‘Chip’ field says “Apple M1”, “Apple M2”, “Apple M3”, or “Apple M4”, you will want to select the ARM version, e.g. “R-4.4.2-arm64.pkg”. If the ‘Chip’ field says you have some version of an Intel chip, pick the other version of R, e.g., “R-4.4.2-x86_64.pkg”.\n\nOnce the software has downloaded, open it by double-clicking."

    "text": "Capturing images in web pages\nMost browsers support “right-clicking”, clicking on the right button of a multibutton mouse (or the equivalent motion on a trackpad) when you hover over an image.\nUsing Chrome on Mac OS for example, I visited the Penn State homepage at https://www.psu.edu. In mousing over a photo, I right clicked and had the following panel appear:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Image from psu.edu in Chrome using MacOS\n\n\n\nNote that there are several options. I find that these are the most useful:\n\n“Open Image in New Tab”. I often do this to make sure that the web page link (URL) actually contains the image I want it to. Then I switch to that tab for further steps.\n“Save Image As…”. This is useful if you want to download a local copy.\n“Copy Image Address”. Use this for capturing URLs of images, but not the images themselves.\n\nHere is an illustration of the same process on Windows 11:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Image from psu.edu on Chrome using Windows 11\n\n\n\nNot that the pop-up has similar options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWord to the wise\n\n\n\nSome websites do not support this feature. That’s why I prefer to use “open image in new tab” to see if I’m actually capturing what I want to capture. As a back-up, you can usually resort to your computer’s built-in screen capture tool that we’ll describe next."

This is the result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Results of right-clicking on psu.edu ‘hero’ image/animation.\n\n\n\nNotice that the pop-up window does not have the same menu items as it did for a static image. Of course, this is an animation, and so it’s not that surprising that things would differ. Let’s say I want to capture a static image from this animation.\n\nPress the screen capture keystroke combination for your computer. On Mac OS, you have two choices, command+shift+3 (pressed simultaneously) immediately takes a screenshot of your entire window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Capturing entire screen on Mac OS using command+shift+3.\n\n\n\nNote that to capture a specific segment of a video, you have to wait until that image appears and press these keys quickly.\n\nAs an alternative on Mac OS, you can use command+shift+4. Then, you click and drag your mouse to indicate the region of the screen you want to capture. When the image appears in the animation, just release the mouse button and that image will be captured.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Capturing a segment of the screen on Mac OS using command+shift+4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder construction\n\n\n\nInstructions about how to do this on Windows are a work-in-progress."

In Gilmore’s case, he has added the following line to that file:\nGMAIL_SURVEY=\"&lt;my-google-account&gt;\"\nHere, he has substituted his Google account with credentials/access to the required files for &lt;my-google-account&gt;. Then, when the R code below calls Sys.getenv(\"GMAIL_SURVEY\"), the value of those credentials is returned as a text string.\nMake sure to close and save the .Renviron file and restart your R session before testing this yourself.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nif (!dir.exists('csv')) {\n  message(\"Creating missing `csv/`.\")\n  dir.create(\"csv\")\n}\n\nif (params$update_data) {\n  options(gargle_oauth_email = Sys.getenv(\"GMAIL_SURVEY\"))\n  googledrive::drive_auth()\n\n  googledrive::drive_download(\n    \"PSYCH-490.003-Spr-2025-Biz-Govt\",\n    path = file.path(\"csv\", params$fn),\n    type = \"csv\",\n    overwrite = TRUE\n  )\n  message(\"Data updated.\")\n} else {\n  message(\"Using stored data.\")\n}\n\n\nThe data file has been saved as a comma-separated value (CSV) format data file in a special directory called csv/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBecause these data might contain sensitive or identifiable information, we only keep a local copy and do not share it publicly via GitHub.
