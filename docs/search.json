The Penn State Principles were developed to embody the values that we hope our students, faculty, staff, administration, and alumni possess. At the same time, the University is strongly committed to freedom of expression. Consequently, these Principles do not constitute University policy and are not intended to interfere in any way with an individual’s academic or personal freedoms. We hope, however, that individuals will voluntarily endorse these common principles, thereby contributing to the traditions and scholarly heritage left by those who preceded them, and will thus leave Penn State a better place for those who follow.\nI will respect the dignity of all individuals within the Penn State community. The University is committed to creating and maintaining an educational environment that respects the right of all individuals to participate fully in the community. Actions motivated by hate, prejudice, or intolerance violate this principle. I will not engage in any behaviors that compromise or demean the dignity of individuals or groups, including intimidation, stalking, harassment, discrimination, taunting, ridiculing, insulting, or acts of violence. I will demonstrate respect for others by striving to learn from differences between people, ideas, and opinions and by avoiding behaviors that inhibit the ability of other community members to feel safe or welcome as they pursue their academic goals.\nI will practice academic integrity. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at Penn State University, allowing the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest, and responsible manner. In accordance with the University Code of Conduct, I will practice integrity in regard to all academic assignments. I will not engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception because such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.\nI will demonstrate social and personal responsibility. The University is a community that promotes learning; any behaviors that are inconsistent with that goal are unacceptable. Irresponsible behaviors, including alcohol or drug abuse and the use of violence against people or property, undermine the educational climate by threatening the physical and mental health of members of the community. I will exercise personal responsibility for my actions and I will make sure that my actions do not interfere with the academic and social environment of the University. I will maintain a high standard of behavior by adhering to the Code of Conduct and respecting the rights of others.\nI will be responsible for my own academic progress and agree to comply with all University policies. The University allows students to identify and achieve their academic goals by providing the information needed to plan the chosen program of study and the necessary educational opportunities, but students assume final responsibility for course scheduling, program planning, and the successful completion of graduation requirements. I will be responsible for seeking the academic and career information needed to meet my educational goals by becoming knowledgeable about the relevant policies, procedures, and rules of the University and academic program, by consulting and meeting with my adviser, and by successfully completing all of the requirements for graduation.\n\n\nPenn State Values\nIntegrity: We act with integrity and honesty in accordance with the highest academic, professional, and ethical standards.\nRespect: We respect and honor the dignity of each person, embrace civil discourse, and foster a diverse and inclusive community.\nResponsibility: We act responsibly, and we are accountable for our decisions, actions, and their consequences.\nDiscovery: We seek and create new knowledge and understanding, and foster creativity and innovation, for the benefit of our communities, society, and the environment.\nExcellence: We strive for excellence in all our endeavors as individuals, an institution, and a leader in higher education.\nCommunity: We work together for the betterment of our University, the communities we serve, and the world."

We’ll take inspiration from recognized classic figures and unpack what makes them exemplary. We’ll critique figures that deliberately or inadvertently mislead or confuse. We’ll learn what 150 years of vision science, the foundation of experimental psychology, has to say about data visualization. And we’ll learn how to build our own reproducible figures using Python, R, and JavaScript. No prior programming experience is required."

    "text": "Students with questions about academic integrity should visit http://www.la.psu.edu/current-students/undergraduate-students/education/academic-integrity.\nPenn State defines academic integrity as the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. All students should act with personal integrity, respect others dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts (Faculty Senate Policy 49-20). Sanctions for academic misconduct can include a grade of F for the course as well as other penalties.\nUnless you are told otherwise, you must complete all course work entirely on your own, using only sources that have been permitted by your instructor, and you may not assist other students with papers, quizzes, exams, or other assessments. If I allow you to use ideas, images, or word phrases created by another person (e.g., from Course Hero or Chegg) or by generative technology, such as ChatGPT, you must identify their source.\nWhen you complete assignments, remember the ABCs to avoid plagiarism: Always place copied information within quotation marks, include information about the quoted or paraphrased source in a Bibliography, and Cite the source in the body (in the text) of your paper immediately after the quoted or paraphrased information. When in doubt, cite in the text and include the source in a bibliography.\nStudents with questions about academic integrity should ask me or the TA before submitting work.\nStudents facing allegations of academic misconduct may not drop/withdraw from the affected course unless they are cleared of wrongdoing (see G-9: Academic Integrity). Attempted drops will be prevented or reversed, and students will be expected to complete course work and meet course deadlines. Students who are found responsible for academic integrity violations face academic outcomes, which can be severe, and put themselves at jeopardy for other outcomes which may include ineligibility for Dean’s List, pass/fail elections, and grade forgiveness. Students may also face consequences from their home/major program and/or The Schreyer Honors College."

    "text": "Values\n\nPenn State Principles\nThe Pennsylvania State University is a community dedicated to personal and academic excellence. The Penn State Principles were developed to embody the values that we hope our students, faculty, staff, administration, and alumni possess. At the same time, the University is strongly committed to freedom of expression. Consequently, these Principles do not constitute University policy and are not intended to interfere in any way with an individual’s academic or personal freedoms. We hope, however, that individuals will voluntarily endorse these common principles, thereby contributing to the traditions and scholarly heritage left by those who preceded them, and will thus leave Penn State a better place for those who follow.\nI will respect the dignity of all individuals within the Penn State community. The University is committed to creating and maintaining an educational environment that respects the right of all individuals to participate fully in the community. Actions motivated by hate, prejudice, or intolerance violate this principle. I will not engage in any behaviors that compromise or demean the dignity of individuals or groups, including intimidation, stalking, harassment, discrimination, taunting, ridiculing, insulting, or acts of violence. I will demonstrate respect for others by striving to learn from differences between people, ideas, and opinions and by avoiding behaviors that inhibit the ability of other community members to feel safe or welcome as they pursue their academic goals.\nI will practice academic integrity. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at Penn State University, allowing the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest, and responsible manner. In accordance with the University Code of Conduct, I will practice integrity in regard to all academic assignments. I will not engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception because such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.\nI will demonstrate social and personal responsibility. The University is a community that promotes learning; any behaviors that are inconsistent with that goal are unacceptable. Irresponsible behaviors, including alcohol or drug abuse and the use of violence against people or property, undermine the educational climate by threatening the physical and mental health of members of the community. I will exercise personal responsibility for my actions and I will make sure that my actions do not interfere with the academic and social environment of the University. I will maintain a high standard of behavior by adhering to the Code of Conduct and respecting the rights of others.\nI will be responsible for my own academic progress and agree to comply with all University policies. The University allows students to identify and achieve their academic goals by providing the information needed to plan the chosen program of study and the necessary educational opportunities, but students assume final responsibility for course scheduling, program planning, and the successful completion of graduation requirements. I will be responsible for seeking the academic and career information needed to meet my educational goals by becoming knowledgeable about the relevant policies, procedures, and rules of the University and academic program, by consulting and meeting with my adviser, and by successfully completing all of the requirements for graduation.\n\n\nPenn State Values\nIntegrity: We act with integrity and honesty in accordance with the highest academic, professional, and ethical standards.\nRespect: We respect and honor the dignity of each person, embrace civil discourse, and foster a diverse and inclusive community.\nResponsibility: We act responsibly, and we are accountable for our decisions, actions, and their consequences.\nDiscovery: We seek and create new knowledge and understanding, and foster creativity and innovation, for the benefit of our communities, society, and the environment.\nExcellence: We strive for excellence in all our endeavors as individuals, an institution, and a leader in higher education.\nCommunity: We work together for the betterment of our University, the communities we serve, and the world."

So, we’re back to summarizing.\nActually, data analysis in the real world usually involves a back-and-forth alternation between summarizing/analyzing and visualizing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A[Summarize] --&gt; B[Visualize]\n  B ---&gt; A\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Illustration of the back and forth between summarizing and visualizing that characterizes real-life data analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummarizing II\nLet’s make data that have an identical pattern across all colors.\nThere are several ways to do this, but here is one that works.\n\n\nCode\nno_favorite &lt;- rep(colors, length(our_color_sample)/length(colors))\n\ncompare_df &lt;- data.frame(favorite_color = no_favorite)\n\nxtabs(formula = ~favorite_color, data = compare_df)\n\n\nfavorite_color\n black   blue  brown   gray  green orange    red violet  white yellow \n    20     20     20     20     20     20     20     20     20     20 \n\n\nHow can we compare the data where there are no differences by category to the data where there are differences?"
